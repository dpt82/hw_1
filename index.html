        <!-- I used in-line coloring for this one, becaue it was an h1 header and if I only wanted to set the color for the "h1" used for a headline, this would be the best bet, incase h1 headers are used elsewhere in a story. I just figured it would be best to get in the habit of doing this, since we learned in-line styling in class this week.-->
